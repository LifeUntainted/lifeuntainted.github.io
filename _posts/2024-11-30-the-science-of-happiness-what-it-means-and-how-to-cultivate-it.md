## What is Happiness?

Happiness is often described as a combination of emotional well-being, life satisfaction, and a sense of purpose. Psychologists break it down into two types:
- **Hedonic Happiness:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain.
- **Eudaimonic Happiness:** A deeper sense of fulfillment derived from meaning and purpose.

The key to lasting happiness lies in balancing these two aspects.

## The Science of Happiness

Research in positive psychology has uncovered several factors that contribute to happiness. While some aspects, like genetics, play a role, a significant portion of our happiness is within our control. Studies suggest:
- **50%** of happiness is influenced by genetics.
- **10%** is determined by life circumstances.
- **40%** comes from intentional activities and mindset.

This means you have the power to create a happier life through your choices and actions.
